# Nobel Prize Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Nobel Prize dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the Nobel Prize data to uncover interesting patterns and trends.

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on the Nobel Prize dataset using Python. The analysis includes handling missing values, generating insightful visualizations, and creating dynamic graphs with `plotly.express`.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and filled or removed missing values in the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized column names and data formats for better analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

During the EDA, the following analyses were performed:

- **Distribution of Nobel Prizes by Year**: Analyzed the number of Nobel Prizes awarded each year.
- **Top Countries by Nobel Prizes**: Visualized which countries have received the most Nobel Prizes.
- **Gender Analysis**: Examined the distribution of Nobel Prizes between male and female recipients.
- **Category Analysis**: Explored the different categories and sub-categories of Nobel Prizes.

## Dynamic Graphs

Using `plotly.express`, dynamic graphs were created to explore:

- **Nobel Prizes by Country and Year**: A time series analysis showing trends in Nobel Prize awards by country over time.
- **Category-Wise Trends**: Interactive visualizations of Nobel Prize distributions across various categories like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, etc.

## Insights

Some of the key insights from the analysis include:

- [Include some specific findings from your analysis, e.g., which country has the most Nobel Prizes, trends in categories, or gender representation.]
